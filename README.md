# PLS - Peer Learing System
## Abstract / Project Description

In the modern education scenario, where students are learning remotely and due to lack of one on one interaction and online learning, individual feedback is next to impossible. Peer learning, which is a solution to all of the above problems, will be the next milestone to be achieved. So, our focus is to build the system on peer learning and feedback based online learning. We have a google classroom to share documents and give feedback, but peers can't discuss it in the thread-like commenting form. We are merging few of the relevant functionalities of LMS of AU, Gyapak, Google classroom, StackOverflow in our peer learning platform. It will be all in one
 platform where students can see their course grades, course feedback, assignment feedback, course wise projects, and much more.
 
 ## Process Model
 We will be using a scrum process model for project management.
 
 ### Reasons to use scrum process model:
  - We don’t have the complete requirements that are needed to develop the peer learning software.
  - We don’t have the complete requirements that are needed to develop the peer learning software.
  - As we are combining several modules, our work will be so much dependent, and so transparency will allow us to excel better.
  - Continuous discussion among team members will significantly reduce the project risk.
  - In a way, it also saves a lot of time which is otherwise wasted in clearing other team member’s doubts.
## Documentation
Complete documentation of the project including <code>Requirement Understanding</code> <code>Design Document</code <code>Screen Wireframes Design</code><code>Technical Architecture</code> <code>Testing Plan</code>  <code>Test Cases</code> <code>Followed Coding Standard</code><code>Scrum Meetings</code>can be found here.
## Note
- This project was part of the Software Engineering Course, so purpose of this project was to learn software engineering practices and processes(as we have followed the Scrum Process Model) through the project work. So we have more focused on documentation part of the project and done a decent job over building the PLS app, so please keep this in mind before judging the work :)
